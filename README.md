# networking
This repository contains a defunct TCP networking C++ framework which I have used in some of my workflows in the past. 

It is no longer actively maintained, therefore I would discourage you from using it yourself. It is provided as-is, and no further support should be expected. 

I am planning to return to it eventually and expand or redo it completely, however, for the time being I have uploaded it here merely for archival purposes. Nevertheless, if you're willing to continue its development prior to my hopeful return, fork up!
